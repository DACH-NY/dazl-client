module MapSupport where

import DA.TextMap

-- DAML used to have a Map type generic on both keys and values, but had a poor representation over the wire.
-- Versions of dazl before 6.3.0 supported serialization of this historical format.
--
-- Since SDK 0.12.0, Map has been deprecated in favor of TextMap, but dazl had kept its support for this old
-- serialization format because there wasn't a compelling reason to drop it. However there isn't a straightfoward
-- way to keep this implementation working while also supporting TextMap serialization long-term, so many of these
-- tests have now been dropped.
--
-- This test may be re-introduced if/when a proper Map type is reintroduced:
