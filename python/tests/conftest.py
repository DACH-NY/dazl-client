    Run an instance of the Sandbox, or use one configured through environment variables.

    Some environment variables change the nature of the Sandbox used in these tests:

     * DAZL_TEST_DAML_LEDGER_URL: If set, it is assumed to be an already-running ledger, and we
       merely return that URL instead of starting up our own sandbox. This is the way that the tests
       run in CI.
     * DAML_SDK_VERSION: If set AND DAZL_TEST_DAML_LEDGER_URL is not specified, this controls the
       version of the Sandbox that is launched through this wrapper. This value can be overridden
       to test dazl against newer (or older) versions of the SDK without making code changes:
         ```
         DAML_SDK_VERSION=1.0.0 make test
         ```
